I spent the first ~8 years of my career exclusively using SPSS and recently began migrating to R. My brilliant friend (and R master) [Danny](https://www.dbkatz.com) once told me that the best way to learn R is by struggling through it, and, unfortunately, he's right. 

Still, some thoughtful scaffolding can go a **long** way.  As the TA of our intro stat sequence, I began creating documents to help students (and myself!) either learn R, or transition from SPSS to R.  

Take a look!

  - [Data](/lab6 data.sav)  
  - *Includes instructions in SPSS (point and click) and the corresponding R script necessary to produce the same output*
