[**Survey Item Validation**](https://www.psyarxiv.com/k27w3/)  
*Abstract*  
In the social sciences, validity refers to the adequacy of a survey (or other mode of assessment) for its intended purpose. Validation refers to the activities undertaken during and after the construction of the survey to evaluate and improve validity. Item validation refers here to procedures for evaluating and improving respondents’ understanding of the questions and response options included in a survey. Verbal probing techniques such as cognitive interviews can be used to understand respondents’ response process, that is, what they are thinking as they answer the survey items. Although cognitive interviews can provide evidence for the validity of survey items, they are time-consuming and thus rarely used in practice. The Response Process Evaluation (RPE) method is a newly-developed technique that utilizes open-ended meta-surveys to rapidly collect evidence of validity across a population of interest, make quick revisions to items, and immediately test these revisions across new samples of respondents. Like cognitive interviews, the RPE method focuses on how participants interpret the item and select a response. The chapter demonstrates the process of validating one survey item taken from the Inventory of Non-Ordinary Experiences (INOE).

[**Thinking Twice About Sum Scores**](https://psyarxiv.com/3wy47/)

*Abstract*

A common way to form scores from multiple-item scales is to sum responses of all items. Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.
