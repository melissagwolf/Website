      <description>Selected preprints or publications Survey Item Validation
Abstract
In the social sciences, validity refers to the adequacy of a survey (or other mode of assessment) for its intended purpose. Validation refers to the activities undertaken during and after the construction of the survey to evaluate and improve validity. Item validation refers here to procedures for evaluating and improving respondentsâ€™ understanding of the questions and response options included in a survey.</description>

      <description>I spent the first ~8 years of my career exclusively using SPSS and recently began migrating to R. My brilliant friend (and R master) Danny once told me that the best way to learn R is by struggling through it, and, unfortunately, he&amp;rsquo;s right.
Still, some thoughtful scaffolding can go a long way. As the TA of our intro stat sequence, I began creating documents to help students (and myself!) either learn R, or transition from SPSS to R.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
